# Data
Data can be found at https://openflights.org/data.php#country, in particular the dataset used is https://github.com/jpatokal/openflights/blob/master/data/routes.dat

# Goal
Goal of the project is to try to cluster the graph of the routes to understand if there is any recognizable pattern in the found communities, depending on the airport activity. 

# Algo
Ideas: hierarchical agglomerative, hierarchical divisive, ...

# TODO
- Which library to use in order to deal with graphs (pythoch_geometric ?)
- By 24/04:
main idea and goal to be definitive
all the algorithm that we actually want to use
From the assignment on Canvas:
Preferably your project proposal is build on your reaction paper and on the scientific papers you have read so far.. Focus on what are some promising further research directions and questions:

How precisely do you plan to pursue them?
What methods/data do you plan to use?
You should try to provide a concrete proposal for a model or algorithm that potentially extends or improves the topics discussed in the papers you've read.
Following questions should be answered:

What is the problem you are solving?
What data will you use (how will you get it)? - We will provide you with initial links
What work do you plan to do the project?
Which algorithms/techniques/models you plan to use/develop? Be as specific as you can!
How will you evaluate your method? How will you test it? How will you measure success?
What do you expect to submit/accomplish by the end of the quarter?
